<h1 style="font-family: Times new roman; text-align: center;color: #191970"><strong><u>About Simran</u></strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: left; font-family: Verdana">Simran moved to United States from India in December 2006 after completing his education to pursue his Masters degree from New York University.
He graduate from NYU with a Masters Degree in Industrial Engineering in jan 2009. Soon after graduating, Simran started working in the private sector as a procurement engineer but he always had 
a dream to serve in the uniformed forces since he was a little kid. In late 2009, Simran heard about this really awesome PILOT Program by US Army called MAVNI(Military Accesions Vital to National Interest).Simran knew it at that point what he wants to do,
so he passed all the examinations and without any problem he joined the program since he spoke three Indian languages which were vital to the National Interest. Army also wanted him but they wanted him to remove his turban, shave his beard and cut his hair off. Simran is a practising Sikh from India and sikhs have a long military tradition tracing back to 16th century.
Simran was up for a fight and after 9 months of legal battle, Simran was granted a rare religious accommodation by the Department of Defence to maintain his beard and turban while serving in the US Army, as long as his unshorn hair, beard and turban does not interfere with any military duties.
Hence, Simran was able to perform all his duties and exceed the standard in any and every training exercise, he was also promoted last year for his exemplary service.
